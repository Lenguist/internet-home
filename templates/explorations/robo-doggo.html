        <h2 class="section-title">the idea</h2>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>What if we could build a robot dog that actually behaves like a dog? Not just walking and running, but understanding its environment, responding to commands, and maybe even developing personality?</p>
            
            <p>This exploration started with a simple question: <em>How hard could it be to build a quadruped robot?</em></p>
            
            <p>Turns out, pretty hard. But also incredibly rewarding.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">what I learned</h2>
        <div class="learning-grid">
            <div class="learning-card">
                <h3>Hardware is Hard</h3>
                <p>Building physical systems taught me to respect the gap between simulation and reality. Every joint has backlash, every sensor has noise, and gravity never takes a break.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="learning-card">
                <h3>Control Theory is Beautiful</h3>
                <p>The mathematics of how to make systems behave the way you want them to is both elegant and practical. PID controllers became my best friends.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="learning-card">
                <h3>Iteration is Everything</h3>
                <p>Version 1 barely stood up. Version 2 could walk forward. Version 3 could turn. Each iteration taught me something new about locomotion.</p>
