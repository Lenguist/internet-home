            <p>My work in the NLP lab focuses on pushing the boundaries of how machines understand and generate human language. The lab environment has been incredible for exploring ideas that bridge theoretical research with practical applications.</p>

                <h3>Long Document Summarization</h3>
                <p>How do you summarize a 500-page book without losing the essential narrative structure? Working with recursive summarization techniques and evaluation metrics.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Multimodal Learning</h3>
                <p>Combining text and images for richer understanding. My work on EraseDraw explores how vision and language models can work together for creative tasks.</p>

                <h3>Ukrainian NLP</h3>
                <p>Building NLP tools for underrepresented languages. My grammar correction work won Best Paper at EACL 2023's Ukrainian NLP workshop.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">what research taught me</h2>
        <div class="text-content">
            <p>Research is equal parts creativity and rigor. You need to dream up new ideas and then ruthlessly test them against reality. The peer review process, while sometimes painful, makes every paper stronger.</p>
            
            <p>Working in an academic lab also taught me the value of collaboration. The best ideas often come from casual conversations over coffee, and diverse perspectives make every project better.</p>
